# Region

The `Region` data type describes the coordinate system that contains [Features](./feature.md). In biological terms, it represents a naturally occurring or an artificially produced polynucleotide. The `Region` has the following fields:

| Field                 | Type                        | Description                                                                                                               |

| code                  | [ValueSet](./value_set.md)  | A ValueSet item containing information about the code of the region                                                       |
| is_top_level          | boolean                     | Flag to highlight whether or not the region can be considered as Top Level or not                                         |
| rank                  | int or null                 | The order of the region (resolves issues with alphanumeric character sorting)                                             |
| topology              | ValueSet                    | A ValueSet item describing the topology of the region - see below                                                         |
| parents               | Array of Region             | A list of the Regions which were used to generate the Region (these will typically be Regions smaller than the Region)    |
| children              | Array of Region             | A list of the Regions which the Region has been incorporated into (these will typically be larger than the Region)        |
| sequence              | Sequence                    | See [Sequence](./sequence.md)                                                                                             |

| length                | integer                     | Length of the region, in nucleotides                                                                                      |
