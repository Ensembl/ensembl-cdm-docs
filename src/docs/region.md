# Region

The `Region` data type describes the coordinate system that contains [Features](./feature.md). In biological terms, it represents a naturally occurring or an artificially produced polynucleotide. The `Region` has the following fields:

| Field                 | Type                        | Description                                                                                                               |

## Code ValueSet
The code ValueSet contains a description about different types of Region, including the following:
- `chromosome`
- `plasmid`
- `scaffold`
- `contig`


## Topology ValueSet
The topology ValueSet contains the following possible values:
- `linear`
- `circular`


## Synonyms
`synonyms` for a region cover alternative means of reference including accession IDs (both versioned and unversioned) and other commonly used names (such as "3" and "chr5").  It should be noted that the latter tend not to have a specific identifiable source and as such do not have accession IDs in their `external_reference` metadata.

## Region hierarchy
The region hierarchy is defined by the relationships a region has with other regions through `made_from` and `part_of`.  These relationships should only be one level deep both ways; a region can link to it direct "parents" and its direct "children", but not directly to its "grandparents" and "grandchildren". For example, a scaffold could be assembled from multiple contigs and be assembled into one chromosome - there is no direct link from the chromosome to the contigs.  

## Assembly
Each `region` will only link to one `assembly`.

## Rank
Based on the order within the karyotype Chromosome 1 = 1, X = 23, Y = 24 (in Human for example).  

## Ordering
To ensure regions are returned in a specific order, it is suggested that implementations of this model extend it with an additional field to capture an "order". This has not been included in the model as it is not essential for describing a region and may be implementation specific.
