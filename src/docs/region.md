# Region

The `Region` data type describes the coordinate system that contains [Features](./feature.md). In biological terms, it represents a naturally occurring or an artificially produced polynucleotide. The `Region` has the following fields:

| is_top_level          | boolean                     | Flag to highlight whether or not the region can be considered as Top Level or not                                         |
| rank                  | int or null                 | The order of the region (resolves issues with alphanumeric character sorting)                                             |

| parents               | Array of Region             | A list of the Regions which were used to generate the Region (these will typically be Regions smaller than the Region)    |
| children              | Array of Region             | A list of the Regions which the Region has been incorporated into (these will typically be larger than the Region)        |

## Code ValueSet
The code ValueSet contains a description about different types of Region, including the following:
- `chromosome`
- `plasmid`
- `scaffold`
- `contig`


## Topology ValueSet
The topology ValueSet contains the following possible values:
- `linear`
- `circular`

## Region hierarchy 
The region hierarchy is defined by the relationships a region has with other regions through `parents` and `children`.  These relationships should only be one level deep both ways; a region can link to it direct parents and its direct children, but not directly to its grandparents and grandchildren. For example, a contig could have multiple parents which are scaffolds and it could have one child which is a chromosome.
