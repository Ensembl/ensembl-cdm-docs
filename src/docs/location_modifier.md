# LocationModifier

The `LocationModifier` data type is used to whether or not a [feature](./feature.md) has a partial start or end, and comprises of the following fields

| Field                     | Type                        | Description |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| partial_start             | boolean                     | defines whether or not the `feature` has a partial start (i.e. its start coordinate falls within a range of possible coordinates)
| partial_end               | boolean                     | defines whether or not the `feature` has a partial end (i.e. its end coordinate falls within a range of possible coordinates)


## Notes
`LocationModifier` will be used to handle the following:


`<1..888       The feature starts before the first sequenced base and
              continues to and includes base 888`

In the above snippet, the `start` coordinate in [Location](./location.md) would be 888 and `partial_start` in `LocationModifier` would be set to true.


## Examples

```json
{
  "partial_start": true,
  "partial_end": false    
}
```
