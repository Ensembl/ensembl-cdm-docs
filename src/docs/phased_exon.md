# Phased Exon

The `Phased Exon` data type combines the immutable, context-independent set of properties of an [Exon](./exon.md) with the properties that characterise arrangement of `exons` in mature messenger RNA. `Phased Exon` has the following fields:

| Field             | Type             | Description |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| index             | integer          | 0-based, denotes order of exons in mature messenger RNA
| start_phase       | ExonPhase        | See below
| end_phase         | ExonPhase        | See below
| exon              | Exon             | context-independent properties of the exon, see [Exon](./exon.md)

## ExonPhase
`ExonPhase` is an enum of integers: `-1`, `0`, `1`, or `2`.

Biologically, `ExonPhase` refers to the position of an exon/intron boundary within a codon. A phase of `0` means the boundary falls between codons, `1` means between the first and second nucleotide, and `2` means between the second and third nucleotide. Phase is always calculated in 5'->3' direction. Since for non-coding transcripts the concept of codon does not apply, non-coding exons have both start and end phase of `-1`.

In ascii art, with alternate codons represented by `###` and `+++`, ExonPhase can be illustrated like this:

```

    Previous Exon   Intron   This Exon
...-------------            -------------...
5'                   Phase                 3'
...#+++###+++###       0    +++###+++###+...
...+++###+++###+       1    ++###+++###++...
...++###+++###++       2    +###+++###+++...

```

## Rationale
Similarly to [SplicedExon](./spliced_exon.md), `Phased Exon` supports the separation of context-independent exon properties (through the `Exon` data type) and the properties that emerge within a context of mature messenger RNA.

## Notes
1. `Phased Exons` are a property of `Product-Generating Context`. Ordinarily, they all are children of the same parent transcript; but in cases of trans-splicing they will include `exons` from other `transcripts`.
