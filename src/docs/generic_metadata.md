# Generic metadata

### OntologyTermMetadata
Ontology term metadata is common across different types of features and also exists on non-features, such as [Region](./region.md). It is an instance of [XrefMetadata](./feature_metadata.md). An example would look as follows:

```json
{
  "accession_id": "SO:0000147",
  "value": "exon",
  "url": "www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_release/term/SO:0000147",
  "source": {
    "id": "...",
    "name": "Sequence Ontology",
    "url": "www.sequenceontology.org",
    "description": "The Sequence Ontology..."
  }
}
```
