# Intron

The `Intron` data type represents a fragment of a [gene](./gene.md) that is removed by RNA splicing to produce the final messenger RNA molecule. It has the following fields:

| Field             | Type             | Description |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| index             | integer          | Index of `Intron`
| slice             | Slice            | See [Slice](./slice.md)
| relative_location | RelativeLocation | See [RelativeLocation](./relative_location.md)
| type              | string           | Type is Intron

## Notes
1. All `introns` that make up a [transcript](./transcript.md) are stored together in a list called `introns`. The index of an `intron` reflects the position of the `intron` relative to its surrounding `introns`. The order is determined by the alternating pattern of [exons](./exon.md) and `introns` in a `transcript`.
2. `Intron` is a [feature](./feature.md) as it shares many characteristics with features (such as genomic location).  However, `Intron` does not have `stable_id`, `unversioned_stable_id` and `version` fields.
